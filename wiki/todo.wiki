#summary Todo list

  * ~~iterator from 0 to x (cdkey/gamelist)~~
    * Wireshark needs a patch to correctly highlight each element in the hexdump.
      * [https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3994 Still not included in 1.2.3]
  * ~~iteration until empty string (S>0x0b getchannellist)~~
    * don't display last empty entry?
  * ~~make clienttag a type (so it's no need to write possible values every time)?~~ - need valuemaps for strdw
  * ~~bitmap decoder (user flag)~~ - displays dword raw value wrong
  * ~~sid_checkad: extension: string[4]~~
  * statstring decoder game and user statstrings
  * "decode as" if both ports not 6112 (e.g. using proxy): can't define who is server and who client
    * At least, add config section at the beginning of the file
  * display summary in info field in packet list and in decoder view
  * dont make dropdown list on iterator with counter if iterator's repeatable block consists of only one operator?
  * ~~Add heading with instructions~~
  * Prevent Wireshark from crashing by properly validating the packets' descriptions and give useful feedback in case of errors.
    * Bug of lua interpreter / wireshark lua interface / wireshark itself?
    * Crashed 1.2.3 and [http://www.wireshark.org/download/prerelease/wireshark-win32-1.2.7pre1-31873.exe latest pre-release win32-1.2.7pre1-31873]. I think, we need to report bug. 1.2.6 [https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4176 didn't even worked on 2000]

==done==
===most important===
  * ~~array of any basic type (actually, uint32[5] may be enough)~~
    * ~~display it as one value (e.g. passhash uint32 [5] - 40 char string)~~
  * ~~conditions (if..)~~
  * ~~string-dword (swap dword and output as string)~~
  * ~~supress raw values output on custom types (time, dwordstr)~~

===less important===
  * ~~ip (network byte order, opposite to intel). For some reason lua's built-in ipv4 uses inter order (lol?)~~
  * ~~windows (?) file time, used in sid_getfiletime~~ 
    * can be converted to posixtime 
    * $unixtime = $wintime/1E7 - 11644473600
  * ~~unips file time~~
  * ~~exe version decoder (like ip, but in intel order)~~
  * ~~enclosed iterators (for s>0x26 readuserdata)~~
  * ~~make clienttag a type (so it's no need to write possible values every time)?~~ - valuemaps for strdw
  * ~~bitmap decoder (user flag)~~
  * ~~sid_checkad: extension: string[4]~~
