#summary Todo list

data types:

===most important===
  * array of any basic type (actually, uint32[5] may be enough)
    * display it as one value (e.g. passhash uint32 [5] - 40 char string)
  * ~~iterator from 0 to x (cdkey/gamelist)~~
    * ~~Wireshark needs a patch for being able to correctly highlight each element in the hexdump.~~
  * ~~iteration until empty string (S>0x0b getchannellist)~~
  * ~~conditions (if..)~~
  * ~~string-dword (swap dword and output as string)~~
  * supress raw values output on custom types (time, dwordstr)

===less important===
  * ~~ip (network byte order, opposite to intel). For some reason lua's built-in ipv4 uses inter order (lol?)~~
  * ~~windows (?) file time, used in sid_getfiletime~~ 
    * can be converted to posixtime 
    * $unixtime = $wintime/1E7 - 11644473600
  * ~~unips file time~~
  * ~~exe version decoder (like ip, but in intel order)~~
  * enclosed iterators (for s>0x26 readuserdata)
  * statstring decoder game and user statstrings
  * bitmap decoder (user flag)
  * sid_checkad: extension: string[4]
