#summary Todo list

data types:

===most important===
  * array of any basic type (actually, uint32[5] may be enough)
  * iterator (cdkey/gamelist)
  * conditions
  * string-dword (swap dword and output as string)

===less important===
  * ~~ip (network byte order, opposite to intel). For some reason lua's built-in ipv4 uses inter order (lol?)~~
  * ~~windows (?) file time, used in sid_getfiletime~~ 
    * can be converted to posixtime 
    * $unixtime = $wintime/1E7 - 11644473600
  * ~~unips file time~~
  * statstring decoder
  * bitmap decoder (user flag)
  * exe version decoder (like ip, but in intel order)
  * sid_checkad: extension: string[4]
