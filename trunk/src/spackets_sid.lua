                   statstring - for example, by logging a different character onto
                   a realm.

                   EID_JOIN:
                   This is sent when a user enters the channel you are
                   currently in.

                   EID_LEAVE:
                   This is sent when a user exits the channel you are
                   currently in.

                   EID_WHISPER:
                   This is sent when a user whispers you.

                   EID_TALK:
                   This is sent when a user (excluding
                   self) in chat speaks.

                   EID_BROADCAST:
                   The username supplied for this event is
                   now always 'Battle.net'. Historically,
                   username contained the name of the
                   Battle.net Administrator who sent the
                   broadcast.

                   EID_CHANNEL:
                   The flags field for this event is used
                   and indicates what special conditions
                   exist for the channel in question. See
                   [Battle.net Flags] for more information.

                   EID_USERFLAGS:
                   This is sent to inform the client of an
                   update to one or more user's flags.
                   Battle.net usually sends this event for
                   every user in the channel, even if only
                   one user's flags have changed. This
                   behavior can be exploited to detect
                   invisible users, by performing an action
                   (such as an unsquelch) to provoke a
                   flags update. Users included in the
                   flags update whose presence has not been
                   indicated by EID_JOIN or EID_SHOWUSER
                   can then be added to the userlist as
                   invisible. Care should be taken,
                   however, to account for the possibility
                   that an asynchronous send error has
                   occurred. Should an EID_JOIN or
                   EID_SHOWUSER event occur for an
                   invisible user, they should be marked as
                   a normal user, not readded to the
                   userlist.

                   EID_WHISPERSENT:
                   The Flags and Ping fields in this packet
                   is equal to the originating user - the
                   one who sent the whisper. In other
                   words, EID_WHISPERSENT contains your
                   flags & ping, not those of the person
                   you whispered.

                   EID_CHANNELDOESNOTEXIST:
                   See info on NoCreate Join in SID_JOINCHANNEL.

                   EID_CHANNELRESTRICTED:
                   This is sent when attempting to join a channel which your
                   client is not allowed to join.

                   EID_INFO:
                   This is information supplied by Battle.net. This text
                   is usually displayed by clients in yellow.

                   EID_Error:
                   This is error information supplied by Battle.net. This
                   text is usually displayed by clients in red.

                   EID_Emote:
                   This is sent when any user (including self) uses the emote
                   feature in chat.

    Remarks:       Used to calculate Client's ping. The received DWORD should be sent
                   directly back to Battle.net.

                   The ping displayed when in chat can be artificially inflated by
                   delaying before sending this packet, or deflated by responding before
                   requested.
                   Ping can be set to -1 (Strictly speaking, 0xFFFFFFFF, since ping is
                   unsigned) by not responding to this packet at all.

                   The received DWORD is not what determines your ping, but it is
                   actually a cookie for the Battle.net server. You should not ever
                   change the DWORD.

                   0x80000001: Realm is unavailable
                   0x80000002: Realm logon failed

                   Any other value indicates failure.

                   The first part of the MCP Chunk that must be sent to the MCP server
                   includes the Status and Cookie DWORDS, making MCP Chunk 1 the first 4
                   DWORDS of the packet.

                   There used to be a WORD at the end of this packet, which was
                   apparently random.

                   If a patch file cannot be found, additional info is set to
                   'non-existent'. If either the executable size/date or the version code
                   is wrong, the server will typically return a failure status.

                   More:
                   While doing a little research on how Battle.net autoupdates it's
                   clients, I found that it (STAR, anyway) does not use the provisions of
                   the SID_AUTH login system to tell clients which update file to
                   download. Instead, it sends a SID_REPORTVERSION (from the previous
                   logon system) containing the equivalent error code and the name of the
                   patch file to download. This seems strange, and makes me think that
                   the part of Battle.net responsible for updating clients is isolated
                   from the part responsible for processing logon requests. If this is
                   the case, it makes sense that that system was never updated, since it
                   must still support legacy clients. In addition, this would explain why
                   most Blizzard clients retain obsolete packet processing code.

    Remarks:       This packet is received after successfully logging onto Battle.net and
                   usually after receiving the first initial chat events. If the client
                   does not respond to this packet, the client gets dropped two minutes
                   later (give or take about 10 seconds).

                   The packet is encrypted via standard RC4 hashing, using one key for
                   outbound data and another for inbound. Its purpose is to download and
                   execute Warden modules. Full information on how to handle this packet
                   may be found at the Rudimentary Warden information topic.

    Used By:       Starcraft Broodwar, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne, Starcraft,
                   Warcraft III

    Format:        (BYTE) Number of Entries
                   For each entry:
                   (STRING) Account

                   (BYTE) Location
                   (DWORD) ProductID
                   (STRING) Location name

    Remarks:       This packet contains the current user's Friends List. If the friend is
                   offline, their ProductID is 0. Location is only supplied when it is
                   relevant - for example, if Status is set to offline (0x00), the
                   location string will be empty.

                   Possible bitwise values for Status:
                   0x01: Mutual
                   0x02: DND
                   0x04: Away
                   Possible values for Location:
                   0x00: Offline
                   0x01: Not in chat
                   0x02: In chat
                   0x03: In a public game
                   0x04: In a private game, and you are not that person's friend.
                   0x05: In a private game, and you are that person's friend.

                   Whether you are a particular user's friend causes different behavior
                   when receiving information about the type of game the user is in (this
                   is true when receiving friend updates, too). When the Location field
                   is 0x04, the user is in a password-protected game, and you are not on
                   that user's friends list. When it is 0x05, the user is in a
                   password-protected game, and you are on that user's friends list.

                   For example, let's say MyndFyre is logging on and Arta[vL] is on his
                   friends list. Arta[vL] is also in a password-protected game. MyndFyre
                   is not on Arta[vL]'s friends list. MyndFyre will receive location 0x04
                   for Arta[vL] and the Channel parameter will be a NULL string. And, if
                   MyndFyre were to type in /f l, Battle.net would respond with
                   SID_CHATEVENT saying "1. Arta[vL] is in a private game."

                   On the other hand, if Arta[vL] had listed MyndFyre as a friend, then
                   on logon, MyndFyre will receive location 0x05 for Arta[vL] and the
                   name of the password-protected game will come through the Channel
                   parameter of the message. If MyndFyre were to type in /f l, Battle.net
                   would respond with "1. Arta[vL] is in the private game vL."

                   Note that there is a Battle.net server bug in which when you are
                   automatically sent this packet, the Product ID is your own Product ID
                   instead of your friend's. So if you were to be using WAR3, for
                   example, and a friend signs on using SEXP, the Product ID in this
                   packet will be WAR3. To receive the *correct* Product ID for the user,
                   you may request another update for this user (by sending 0x66 back to
                   the server with the same Entry Number), or request the full list
                   again.

                   In addition, this packet is not sent to you automatically if the
                   friendship is not mutual.
